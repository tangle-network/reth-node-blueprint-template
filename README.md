# Tangle Reth Node Blueprint

A blueprint template for running and managing RETH nodes on the Tangle Network. This blueprint enables anyone to deploy and monetize Ethereum RPC access through a managed RETH node infrastructure.

## Why This Matters

Running Ethereum nodes is complex and expensive. This blueprint abstracts away the operational complexity while providing a template that can further be usedfor monetization and access control. Instead of wrestling with infrastructure, developers can focus on building applications.

## Core Features

Our blueprint handles the heavy lifting of RETH node management:

- Automated node deployment and health monitoring
- Graceful startup/shutdown sequences
- Container-based isolation
- Comprehensive logging and diagnostics
- RPC endpoint management

## Future Roadmap

Join us in building the future of Ethereum node infrastructure! Here's what's coming next:

**Access Control & Security**

- IP-based access control and rate limiting
- JWT authentication for RPC endpoints
- Configurable firewall rules
- Multi-tenant isolation

**Monetization**

- Pay-per-request billing
- Subscription-based access
- Usage-based pricing tiers
- Automated payments via smart contracts

**Monitoring & Analytics**

- Request metrics per endpoint/user
- Performance analytics
- Resource utilization tracking
- Cost analysis tools

## Getting Started

1. Install the Tangle CLI:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/releases/download/cargo-tangle-v0.1.2/cargo-tangle-installer.sh | sh
```

2. Deploy your node:

```bash
cargo tangle blueprint deploy
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that enhance node management, improve security, or add new features. Our goal is to make this the go-to solution for running production RETH nodes on Tangle.
